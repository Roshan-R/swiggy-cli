swiggy-cli is a cli application to track your swiggy order. It makes use of user provided browser cookies and calls the SwiggyAPIs to fetch and show data.
It checks the status of the last order you placed, and if it's an ongoing order a simple downloader-like progress bar shows up with real time updates.

## Installation

Currently, no pre-build binaries are given. To try this out, you could clone the repo and build the binary yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Roshan-R/swiggy-cli
cd swiggy-cli
go build .
```

this will produce a binary in the current directory.

## Contributing

Contributing to the project is more than welcome, if by code or ideas :)
